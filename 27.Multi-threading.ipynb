        "## Understanding Multi-threading\n",
        "Multi-threading is a parallel execution technique that allows a single process to manage the execution of multiple threads. Threads are the smallest unit of a CPU's execution, and they share the same memory space of the process they belong to.\n",
        "### Advantages of Multi-threading\n",
        "1. **Improved Responsiveness**: Applications can remain responsive to input even if part of it is waiting for a long operation to complete.\n",
        "2. **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process can share resources, making it efficient.\n",
        "3. **Scalability**: Multi-threading can take advantage of the CPU's multiple cores, leading to better performance on multi-core systems.\n",
        "### Disadvantages of Multi-threading\n",
        "1. **Complexity**: Writing thread-safe code is complex and can lead to problems like deadlocks, race conditions, etc.\n",
        "2. **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging multi-threaded applications can be more challenging compared to single-threaded applications.\n",
        "### Multi-threading in C++\n",
        "C++11 introduced support for multi-threading in the standard library. Here's a simple example of creating a thread in C++:\n",
