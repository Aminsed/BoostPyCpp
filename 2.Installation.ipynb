        "1. **Python:** Boost.Python is a wrapper for C++ to be used in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **C++ Compiler:** As Boost.Python is a C++ library, you need to have a C++ compiler. If you are using Windows, you can use Visual Studio. For Linux, you can use g++ and for MacOS, you can use Clang.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **CMake:** CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. You can download it from the official CMake website: https://cmake.org/download/\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have these installed, you can proceed with the installation of Boost.Python."

        "4. **Install Boost.Python:** Finally, you need to install Boost.Python. This involves copying the built Boost.Python library to a location where your compiler can find it.\n",
