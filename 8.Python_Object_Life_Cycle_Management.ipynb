        "# Python Object Life Cycle Management using Boost.Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Boost.Python is a C++ library used to interface Python and C++. It allows you to write Python classes in C++ and use them in Python code. One of the key aspects of using Boost.Python is understanding how it manages the life cycle of Python objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will cover the following topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Introduction to Boost.Python\n",
        "2. Python Object Life Cycle\n",
        "3. Boost.Python and Python Object Life Cycle\n",
        "4. Code Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction to Boost.Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Boost.Python is a C++ library that is used to interface Python and C++. It allows you to write Python classes in C++ and use them in Python code. This is particularly useful when you have performance-critical code that needs to be written in C++, but you want to use Python for the rest of your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Python Object Life Cycle\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the life cycle of an object includes its creation, manipulation, and deletion.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Creation**: An object is created when you define a variable and assign a value to it. For example, when you do `a = 5`, a Python integer object is created and its reference is assigned to the variable `a`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Manipulation**: You can manipulate the object by changing its value. For example, you can do `a = a + 1` to change the value of `a` to 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deletion**: An object is deleted when there are no references to it. Python's garbage collector automatically deletes objects that are no longer in use. You can also manually delete an object using the `del` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Boost.Python and Python Object Life Cycle\n",
        "\n",
        "Boost.Python provides a way to manage the life cycle of Python objects in C++ code. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Creation**: You can create a Python object in C++ using the `boost::python::object` class. For example, you can do `boost::python::object a(5)` to create a Python integer object with the value 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Manipulation**: You can manipulate the Python object using the `attr` function. For example, you can do `a.attr(\"__add__\")(1)` to add 1 to the value of `a`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deletion**: Boost.Python automatically manages the deletion of Python objects. When a `boost::python::object` goes out of scope, its destructor is called, which decreases the reference count of the Python object. If the reference count becomes zero, the Python object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Code Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some code examples that illustrate how to manage the life cycle of Python objects using Boost.Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 Creating a Python Object\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the Python integer object is automatically deleted when the `test` function returns and the `boost::python::object` goes out of scope.\n",
