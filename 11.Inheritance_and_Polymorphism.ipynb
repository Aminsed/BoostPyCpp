        "# Inheritance and Polymorphism in Boost.Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Boost.Python is a C++ library used to interface Python and C++. It allows you to write Python classes in C++ and vice versa. In this notebook, we will discuss two important concepts in object-oriented programming: inheritance and polymorphism, and how they are implemented in Boost.Python.\n",

        "## Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class. The new class is called a derived class or child class, and the existing class is called the base class or parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Boost.Python, you can define a base class in C++ and then derive a class from it in Python. Here is an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```cpp\n",
        "#include <boost/python.hpp>\n",
        "\n",
        "class Base {\n",
        "public:\n",
        "    virtual ~Base() {}\n",
        "    virtual std::string getName() const { return \"Base\"; }\n",
        "};\n",
        "\n",
        "BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(inheritance_example) {\n",
        "    boost::python::class_<Base>(\"Base\")\n",
        "        .def(\"getName\", &Base::getName)\n",
        "    ;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Python script, you can create a derived class like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import inheritance_example\n",
        "\n",
        "class Derived(inheritance_example.Base):\n",
        "    def getName(self):\n",
        "        return \"Derived\"\n",
        "\n",
        "d = Derived()\n",
        "print(d.getName())  # Outputs: Derived\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is a feature that allows you to treat objects of different classes in the same way. It is closely related to inheritance. In fact, polymorphism is often achieved through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Boost.Python, you can achieve polymorphism by defining a virtual function in the base class and overriding it in the derived class. Here is an example:\n",

        "};\n",
        "\n",
        "class Derived : public Base {\n",
        "public:\n",
        "    std::string getName() const override { return \"Derived\"; }\n",
        "};\n",

        "\n",
        "In the Python script, you can use the `Derived` class like this:\n",
