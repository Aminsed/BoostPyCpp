        "# Python's Hash Protocol\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the hash protocol consists of the `__hash__` method. This method returns an integer value and is used for quick key comparison in dictionaries. Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their `id()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of a simple class with a `__hash__` method:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __hash__(self):\n",
        "        return hash((self.name, self.age))\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the `__hash__` method returns a hash value that is based on a tuple of the object's name and age attributes. This means that two `Person` objects with the same name and age will have the same hash value.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that for an object to be used as a dictionary key, it must support both the `__hash__` method and the `__eq__` method. The `__eq__` method is used to compare two objects for equality. If two objects compare equal, their hash values must also be equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hash Protocol and Mutability\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, mutable objects cannot be hashed. This is because a change in the object's value would change the hash value, which would lead to inconsistencies and potential issues when using the object as a dictionary key. For example, lists and dictionaries are mutable, and therefore unhashable. However, tuples are immutable and therefore hashable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have a custom class and you want to make instances of it unhashable, you can do so by setting `__hash__ = None` in the class definition. This will effectively make instances of the class unhashable, and attempting to retrieve the hash of an instance will result in a `TypeError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hash Collisions\n",
        "\n",
        "A hash collision occurs when two different objects produce the same hash value. Python handles hash collisions in the background. If two objects have the same hash value but are not equal, Python will be able to keep them as separate keys in a dictionary. This is done by using a technique called 'open addressing'."

        "The hash protocol can be used to speed up the lookup of C++ objects in Python. By hashing the objects and storing them in a Python dictionary, you can achieve constant-time lookup of the objects, which can be significantly faster than searching through a list or other data structure.\n",

        "In a distributed system, consistent hashing can be used to distribute data across multiple nodes in a way that minimizes re-distribution of data when nodes are added or removed. If you have a C++ implementation of a consistent hashing algorithm, you can expose it to Python using Boost.Python, and use the hash protocol to hash Python objects for use with the algorithm."
