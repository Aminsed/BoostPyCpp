        "- **Compatibility**: There might be runtime issues due to differences in system libraries and calls, even with successful cross-compilation.\n",
        "- **Virtual Machines**: Consider using virtual machines or dual-boot setups to compile natively on the target OS. This approach can simplify the process and reduce compatibility issues."

        "### Conclusion and Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we delved deep into the realm of cross-compilation with a specific focus on Boost.Python. Cross-compilation is an essential technique that allows developers to compile code for a different platform than the one they are currently working on. This is especially crucial when targeting platforms with different architectures or operating systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key takeaways from our exploration include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Boost.Python**: This library facilitates the integration of C++ and Python, allowing developers to expose C++ classes and functions to Python and vice versa.\n",
        "- **Cross-Compilation for Raspberry Pi**: We discussed the process of cross-compiling a Boost.Python module from a typical PC (x86 architecture) to run on a Raspberry Pi (ARM architecture). This involved setting up the appropriate toolchain, configuring Boost.Build, and handling potential challenges.\n",
        "- **Cross-Compilation between macOS and Windows**: A more intricate process, we explored how one might cross-compile between these two major operating systems. This involved understanding the unique challenges posed by each OS, setting up the right toolchains, and being aware of licensing and compatibility issues.\n",
        "- **Real-World Application with a Robotic Arm**: To provide a practical perspective, we conceptualized a robotic arm controlled via a Boost.Python module. This example showcased the potential of combining the performance of C++ with the flexibility of Python, especially in the realm of robotics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, cross-compilation is a powerful technique that, while sometimes challenging, opens up a world of possibilities for developers. Whether it's bringing high-performance algorithms to embedded devices or ensuring software compatibility across platforms, the ability to cross-compile is a valuable skill in the modern developer's toolkit."
