        "\n",
        "Boost.Python is a C++ library used to interface Python and C++. It allows you to write Python classes in C++ and vice versa. One of the features of Boost.Python is function overloading. In this notebook, we will discuss how to overload functions using Boost.Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "Overloading is a feature in programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters. Overloading can occur with functions and with operators. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we might have a function that adds two integers and another function with the same name that adds two floats. The correct function to use is determined by the arguments we provide when we call the function.\n",

        "<a id='section2'></a>\n",
        "## 2. Overloading in C++\n",
        "\n",
        "In C++, function overloading is straightforward. Here is an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```cpp\n",
        "#include <iostream>\n",
        "\n",
        "void print(int i) {\n",
        "    std::cout << \" Here is int \" << i << std::endl;\n",
        "}\n",
        "void print(double  f) {\n",
        "    std::cout << \" Here is float \" << f << std::endl;\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "int main() {\n",
        "    print(10);\n",
        "    print(10.10);\n",
        "    return 0;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we have two functions named `print`. One function takes an integer as an argument and the other takes a float. When we call the `print` function with an integer, the first function is called. When we call it with a float, the second function is called.\n",

        "<a id='section3'></a>\n",
        "## 3. Overloading in Boost.Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Boost.Python, overloading is a bit more complex because Python does not support function overloading. However, Boost.Python provides a way to overload functions by using the `def` function in combination with `boost::python::args`.\n",
