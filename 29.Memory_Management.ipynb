        "\n",
        "Python's Context Manager Protocol is a mechanism that allows developers to allocate and release resources precisely when they want to. The most common use case in Python is the `with` statement, which ensures that resources are acquired and released around a block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Boost.Python, this protocol plays a crucial role in managing memory, especially when interfacing with C++ objects. By leveraging the Context Manager Protocol, Boost.Python ensures that C++ objects are correctly managed, avoiding memory leaks and ensuring optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The protocol consists of two main methods:\n",
        "- `__enter__`: This method is called when the `with` block is entered. It can return an object that will be used within the block.\n",
        "- `__exit__`: This method is called when the `with` block is exited. It handles the cleanup, ensuring that resources are released.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of Boost.Python, these methods are often overridden to handle the acquisition and release of C++ resources."
